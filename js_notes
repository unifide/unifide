Magnifide (main controller)
    project : Project
    editors : Editor[]

Project (main model)
    assets : Asset[] {1}

// A single element in the project, e.g. a class or table
Asset

PackageAsset : Asset
ClassAsset : Asset
MethodAsset : Asset
TableAsset : Asset

// One editing panel, one window can have many of these
Editor (main view)
    contexts : Context[] {2}

// An editor can have a single active context at a time
Context (sub controller) {3}
    widget : ContextWidget {4}

ProjectContext : Context

ClassContext : Context
FileContext : Context
DatabaseContext : Context
TableContext : Context

{1} Will probably need to be a more complex structure than just an array.
{2} Even though an editor can have multiple contexts, only one is active at a time.
{3} Context is a superclass and is never actually used, classes such as FileContext, ClassContext, TableContext, etc. inherit from Context.
{4} ContextWidget isn't actually a class, but can be any widget that meets the required specs.
